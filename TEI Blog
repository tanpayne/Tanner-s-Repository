         <p>We go away tomorrow, and they are moving all my furn-iture down again to leave things as they were before.</p>
         
         <p>Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.</p>
         
         <p>She laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.<space/>How she betrayed herself that time!</p>
         
         <p>But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me&#8212;not alive!</p>
         
         <p>She tried to get me out of the room&#8212;it was too patent! But I said it was so quiet and empty
         
         <pb n="52"/>
            and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner&#8212;I would call when I woke!</p>
            
            <p>So now she is gone, and the servants, and the things, and there is nothing left but the great bedstead, nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.</p>
            
            <p>We shall sleep down stairs tonight, and take the boat home tomorrow.</p>
            
            <p>I quite enjoy the room now it is bare again.</p>
            
            <p>How those children did tear about here! This bed-stead is fairly gnawed!</p>
            
            <pb n="53"/>
               <p>But I must get to work.</p>
               
               <p>I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.</p>
               
               <p>I don't want to go out, and I don’t want to have any-body come in until John comes. I want to astonish him.</p>
               
               <p>I’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!</p>
               
               <p>But I forgot I couldn’t reach far without anything to stand on! The bed will <hi rend="underline">not</hi> move. I tried to lift or push it till I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece
                  
                  
                  <pb n="54"/>
                     at one corner&#8212;but it hurt my teeth.</p>
                     
                     <p>Then I peeled off all <add place="above">the paper</add> I could reach <del rend="strikethrough">from</del> <add place="above">standing on</add> the floor. It sticks horribly. And the pattern just enjoys it. All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!</p>
                        
                        <p>I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try. Besides I wouldn’t do it of course! I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misunderstood.</p>
                           
                           <p>I don’t like to <hi rend="underline">look</hi> out.</p>
