### Grant Reflection

It's really crazy to think about how far I've come with Digital Humanities projects. The whole course has led up to this, 
and I feel as though I'm not only comfortable with the discipline, but I am also confident in my skills in identifying, 
critiquing, and even creating Digital Humanities projects. Though I did not *necessarily* want to take this course, I am
glad I did and I would reccomend this course to any aspiring Writing student.

The grant itself was very easy to complete, and honestly, I feel like I had a handle of the grant about two weeks ago. With
the split deadlines, like how we went over each individual step, only writing a page and a half at a time, it made things 
feel a lot less daunting. Among this, the fact that the peer reviews being optional made it more enticing to finish on time, 
which is almost oxymoronic. Not only that, I had an emotional attachment to what I was writing, which was a worry of mine 
earlier into the course. Being able to identify with a topic makes it a lot less mentally taxing to write about, and I felt
like I could get a lot of mileage on writing about teaching Shakespeare. 

I do not believe I will pursue the grant in actuality, *but* I am proud of the work I put in with the proposal, and personally,
I feel like the person who would hypothetically give me the grant would be a moron to not. It feels like a breath away to 
pursue, if that was the path I would take. I am confident in this grant, to say the least.
