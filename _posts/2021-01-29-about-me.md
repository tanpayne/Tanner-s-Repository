# My name is Tanner Payne.

Welome to my blog. This is my third year at CNU.
My pronouns are he/him.
I have no particular interest in the DH minor, but I am taking this course to fulfill my major/minor writing intensive requirements.
I am a writing minor, with a specific interest in playwriting.
After college, I plan on entering the acting career pool, and I also hope to establish myself as a playwrite. I hope that one day down the line,
I can open up my own theater and write shows and produce them.

Thus far, I have been in two professional productions, including a Jason Mraz music video, and a pre-Broadway run of a show by Drew Gaspirini.
The Jason Mraz music video was a collaboration of tons of young artists as a tribute to his hometown. The video is on youtube, and if you're curious
enough to search, look for "Jason Mraz Have it All." I'm in like a solid 5 seconds of spotlight, but I'm not going to give away which five seconds, as
I look like a total dweeb in it. The pre-Broadway run was an interesting little project that was done pre-Covid. It was a song cycle revolving around a
loose story, which is like many of Drew's works (that being a work in progress). I'm not sure how much more I can legally say on the subject.

I come from Richmond, Virginia, though I moved to Tenessee for eight years, before moving back to Richmond in 2014.
I have tons of dogs at home, 5 to be exact. I don't belong to fandoms, but I do appreciate things such as writing, video games, and other various hobbies,
like playing guitar, and even puppeteering (that's more of a guilty pleasure.) I look forward to learning more on the subject of DH with you all,
and I hope that this isn't too much of a hassle to read.
