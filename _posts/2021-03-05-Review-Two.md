## Project Director: Greg Pickman
### Project URL: http://atlas.lib.uiowa.edu/

**Project Breakdown**
This project is a cultivation of research, coding, and data collection from various digital and printed sources. Its aim is to provide not only a mapping, but also a timeline of  the spread, output, and typography of early printing technology. The project features data from 1450 AD to 1500 AD in regards to the progress of printing, conflicts that arose, as well as locations and universities that increased previously mentioned spread.
