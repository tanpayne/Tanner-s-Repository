# Project: Atlas of Early Printing
### Project Director: Greg Pickman
##### Project URL: http://atlas.lib.uiowa.edu/

**Project Breakdown:**
This project is a cultivation of research, coding, and data collection from various digital and printed sources. The aim of the project is to provide not only a mapping,
but also a timeline of  the spread, output, and typography of early printing technology. The project features data from 1450 AD to 1500 AD in regards to 
the progress of printing, conflicts that arose, as well as locations and universities that increased previously mentioned spread.

**Project Features:**
Below is a screenshot of the basic features of the map:

As shown here, the features of the map include a legend to the left, a scaled map of the world, and a moveable timeline at the top of the map. The legend
to the let is able to be marked and unmarked to show the individual data points, which change depending on the year(s) being shown in the timeline. This 
allows the user to look at as many, or as little data points as they want, as well as showing the change overtime. Each data point on the map can be 
expanded by clicking on their icons. An example of this below:

The site also features resources on other pages that the user can navigate at the top of the website. These features include a walkthrough on how to use 
the website and how to use it, as well as information on the project developers, the history of the project, and additional information on the development of 
printing in Europe. The additional information provided is useful due to the fact that the videos provide a visual representation of the developing printing
technology. This can give the user contextual information about the history, as well as just being a pretty neat addition to the project itself. A screenshot
of this is provided below:

**Setbacks:**
This site has *many* excellent features with tons of data representation that makes it very simple and visually pleasing. Although this is a great project, 
there is still room for improvement when it comes to navigating the site. For example, it is rather tough to use the sliding timeline to get an accurate 
representation of the data between two specific points in time. As well as this, the site also has a bit of trouble when it comes to *playing* the timeline. 
Sometimes, when the user attempts to press the play button to automate the visual changes over time. As I am not much of a programmer, I don't exactly know 
how to mitigate this problem, and it might simply be a bug in the programming. The site also does not work over mobile, so much so that the map is unable to
be seen at all.

Another issue that is noticeable is the fact that the data represented is only of Europe during a specific time period. The map shows the entire world, while
the data only depicts that of Europe. Because the map is so large, it is easy to get lost when it comes to locations. Perhaps if the map were to be cropped 
to where only the useful information was being shown, such as just Europe, the Mediterranean area, and part of Northern Africa.

**Review:**
Overall, this project makes great use of information and visuals to present the data of the early printing technology in a way that is easy to understand and
digest. The site is also very easily cited, *and* provides its bibliography, which makes it simple to backtrack the information to its source(s). This site 
is a great source of information for scholars, or even just people interested in the information it renders.
