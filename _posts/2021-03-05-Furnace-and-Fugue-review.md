**Review**

Furnace and Fugue, digital resource, is a great archive that was adapted from Atalanta fugiens, 
a book designed to explore the alchemical allegory of fifty emblems. The site is visually pleasing, 
with a minimalist approach that is organized and uniform. The digital resource was made available 
online by Tara Nummedal  and Donna Bilak. In order to bring the seventeenth century texts to the 
contemporary world in a way that is easy to read, manipulate and investigate. The site has three 
main tabs labelled Contents, Atalanta fugiens, and Scholarly Essays.

***Contents***
  Under the contents tab, one can view the entire collection of information, including the texts, 
  scholarly essays, and more. It is laid out in a way that is easy to understand and explore. Through
  the links, one can explore a digital version of the text, a biography of the author, as well as a 
  behind the scenes look at the creation of the play. This is honestly the messiest tab. However, the
  tab is chocked full of information, which is hard to remedy in a way that would present the
  information in a way that is clean and easy to navigate. 

***Atalanta fugiens***
   Under this tab, one can view the collection of 50 emblems, along with their respective pictures. 
   Along with these, there are tabs for the title, an epigram, a dedication page, and a page for the 
   preface. One can view the original title page in a digital format, as well as in text format. Under 
   the epigram tab of the page, one can view the original epigram, as well as a text formatted version. 
   This is true for the following tabs. This tab is very well set up, and easy to navigate. In my opinion,
   this is the best set tab in the digital resource.

***Scholarly Essays***
  This tab features essays written in regards to the emblems and the work as a whole. One can view essays
  in full, as well as different digital resources, including videos, pictures, and bibliographic information.
  This tab is nicely formatted, though there is a lack of relevant information to the essays so that you can
  preview it before you go to the page. This might be remedied by adding an abstract to each of the links on the tab.
