This assignment felt a lot like I was actually coding, more so than I have felt in the past assignments. I think this was because
the software we used helped walk us through the process of coding the text mark up. Notably, I was able to code through the first
time with minimal errors. Granted, I think that this was because the assignment details on the website gave specific instructions
that allowed me to be able to accurately mark up the text before I put it into Oxygen. 

I was very proud of the work I put in for this assignment because it made me feel very accomplished with every step I took in the 
assignment. Each step, from marking the text, to copying it to Oxygen, editing where there were mistakes in the coding, to putting
the finishing steps on the repository, was smooth and the process, after getting some feedback from the professor, felt very doable.

It has been a while since I checked out the software, so my 30 day trial has expired. Because of this, I can't take a look at the 
coding that I did, nor can I take a picture of the coding itself. From what I remember, there weren't any places that I was unable
to code, save for two or three mark ups in the text that did not have specific coding for it.

Overall, I thought that this assignment and the coding, for what it was, was great! I  am also glad that I could be a part of the 
project that is being worked on for it, and I hope that my coding can help further the project in any way.
